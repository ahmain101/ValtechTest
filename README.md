I would say this is a second level answer so it's functional but I tried not to hard code every step. 
I split it into 3 scenarios but it could have been done in 1 or 2 as well.
The driver is hardcoded to chromedriver for my pc and would therefore need to be changed to point to a chromedriver instance to run.
The answer could be refined further without the time constraint so therefore it does the job but I wouldn't class it as best practice.
